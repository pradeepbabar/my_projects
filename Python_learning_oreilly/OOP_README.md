## What is OOP (Object Orinterd programmign language)
-`OOP`: A way to organize the code into "classes"
a class contains a set of variables & functions

lets take a example of a ROBOT in which we will provide some attributies to it & functionalities for same

                                    
Robot's attributies:                -> Robot            -> Class Name
-Name                               -> Name            |
-Version Number                     -> Version_number  | -> Attrubutes
-Temprature                         -> temprature      |
-Etc

Robot's functionalities:
-Say hi                             -> say_hi()        |
-Print internal info                -> print_info()    | -> Methods
-initialize its hardware            -> init_hardware() |
-Etc
